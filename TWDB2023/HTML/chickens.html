            <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of
                wildspecies<br>
                such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl<sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_junglefowl">[1]</a></sup> that are originally
                from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are terms <br>
                for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
                capon. An adult<br>
                female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens
                primarily as a<br>
                source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for
                cockfighting,<br>
                which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are
                layers.

            <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia,
                and East Asia, <br>
                but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
                subcontinent.<br>
                From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the
                mid-15th<br>
                century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and
                Shinar, Babylonia,<br>
                according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century
                BC.</p>
