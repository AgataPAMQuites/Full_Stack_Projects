    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
        species
        such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are
        terms
        for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
        adult
        female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily
        as a
        source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for
        cockfighting,
        which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.

    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,
        [3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the
        mid-15th century
        BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
        according to
        the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.</p>
